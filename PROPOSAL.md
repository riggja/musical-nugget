# Group Project: Star Wars Pong


## Problem Definition


The goal of this game is to cause unconstrained suffering to the maimed Luke Skywalker
by bouncing his severed hand off of harmless lightsabers, preferrably Darth Vader's and Luke Skywalker's,
that are restrained on their respective vertical axes


__Key Features__

* Audio and graphics are Star Wars themed.
* Pseudorealistic Physics 
* SFML will be used to implement these.
* Handicapped and Player-overidable AI (i.e. the computer can play against itself, a player can play against the computer, or two players can play against each other).


__Assumptions__

1. The art and sound will be taken from the Original Trilogy, as well as the end of Revenge of the Sith ("Nooooo").
2. The product will not be publicly released so as to prevent conflict with creative licensing
